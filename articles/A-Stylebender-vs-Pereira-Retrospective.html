      <h1>A Stylebender vs. Pereira Retrospective</h1>
      <p class="post-meta"><em>Posted on July 19, 2025</em></p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The Israel “Stylebender” Adesanya x Alex “Poatan” Pereira feud is, in my view, the greatest rivalry in MMA history. I’d imagine most fans would find this sentiment controversial, instead recollecting the McGregor-Khabib or Jones-Cormier feuds, with fonder eyes. But unlike those rivalries, which were fueled by insignificant personal hatred and decisively won by one side, Adesanya-Pereira was one of pure, evenly matched competition spanning 1 decade, 4 fights, and 2 different sports. If you are unaware, I recommend you enrich your FYP with the cinema that is Adesanya X Pereira X Duckworth edits on TikTok.</p>
      <p>Now that Adesanya is on a downswing (0-3 in his last three), and Pereira has flirted with retirement, their beef, much like some refrigerated leftovers, has gone cold, making it the perfect time to reheat it with my hot take: Israel Adesanya won the rivalry.</p>

      <h2>The Story Retold</h2>
      <p>Lettuce begin with an “objective” retelling of the rivalry, void of my narrative.</p>
      <p>Israel Adesanya and Alex Pereira first met, not in an octagon, but rather a ring. A ring, more specifically, owned and operated by Glory Kickboxing. They met on April 2, 2016, in Shenzhen, China, ten fights below the main event, in front of a crowd more sparsely attended than my middle school band concerts. In such unspectacular conditions, their rivalry was born.</p>
      <p>Immediately, the stylistic differences between the two were apparent, and these differences would define the entirety of their war: Izzy, the slick, stance-switching sniper. Poatan, the pressuring, power puncher.</p>
      <p>In this first fight, Pereira was awarded a unanimous decision after nine minutes of action. This was, however, controversial, as many observers (myself included) now believe that while close, the decision probably should have gone Adesanya’s way.</p>
      <p>This sentiment was echoed by fans at the time, and a rematch was scheduled the following year in São Paulo, Brazil. This one ended in a vicious KO win for Pereira with his patented left hook. The severity of this knockout, which forced Adesanya to receive immediate oxygen assistance afterward, overshadows another theme of their rivalry. People forget, man, but Izzy was dominating that fight until hit with the left hook.</p>
      <p>That left hook did more damage than we thought as it apparently knocked Adesanya out of the kickboxing world entirely, and into the orbit of the UFC. Here, he found immediate and meteoric success, winning his first five fights in the Octagon, against names like Derek Brunson, Marvin Vettori (still a ranked contender), and UFC legend Anderson Silva. Clearly, Adesnaya’s kickboxing base translated seamlessly to MMA.</p>
      <p>Adesanya’s career climaxed at UFC 236, where he faced Kelvin Gastelum for the Interim UFC Middleweight Championship. In what is now my favorite fight of all time, and officially the 2019 Fight of the Year. With the scorecards tied 2–2 heading into the fifth, Izzy whispers to himself, “I am prepared to die.” and delivers one of the most dominant rounds of his career, earning himself a unanimous decision win. He followed that with a clean KO win over Robert Whittaker to become the undisputed champion.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Pereira was belt collecting in his own right and had become the first fighter in Glory to simultaneously hold both the Middleweight and Light Heavyweight titles. [If any of my friends are reading this, the first person who texts me the word “System” I will venmo you money] With little left to prove in kickboxing, he made the jump to MMA and, after a handful of wins, signed with the UFC, thanks in part to Adesanya, who dismissed him as nothing more than “a guy in a bar”. Now in the limelight we learned the two men’s personalities clashed as much as their fighting style. Where Adesnaya relished the fame and stardom associated with his brand, Poatan seemed only interested in violence.</p>
      <p>Due to his past success against Adesanya and the fact that Izzy had vanquished all contenders in the weight class, Pereira was fast-tracked to a title shot. At UFC 281, five years after their first encounter, they met again. In this fight, like every other, Adesanya nearly knocked Pereira out in the first round and entered the final round winning, 3 rounds to 1. History repeats itself and that's just how it goes and in this final round Pereira walked Izzy down and scored a comeback victory by TKO.</p>
      <p>Down 3 to 0 to his foil, who had robbed him of belt, wealth, fame, and fanbase, Adesanya, unflinchingly, demanded an immediate rematch. Knowing there would be no second (or rather fifth) chance if he lost, and with his back literally and figuratively against the wall, Izzy checkmated Pereira with two right hooks that left Poatan frozen like Elsa. With that, Adesanya could finally lay claim to a victory over his nightmare and celebrated by shooting 3 arrows into the lifeless corpse of his nemesis.</p>

      <h2>Victory in Defeat</h2>
      <p>After that last fight, Adesanya declared victory in the rivalry, professing: “He who laughs last, laughs best.” To this day, the majority of fans reject this idea, and in pure bot-like fashion, swarm any pro-Izzy posts with mindless “3–1,” comments, of course alluding to their head-to-head record.</p>
      <p>I disagree with this sentiment entirely and chalk this up to the fact that people don’t like Izzy anymore, (Probably because of the dog incident) and Pereira’s had much more success after their last fight.</p>
      <p>These two points however are irrelevant to the question of who won their rivalry. Pereira may well be an all time greater fighter but that is a separate question to who won their rivalry.</p>
      <p>The first thing to note is that the “3-1” discourse, void of any context, is an inadequate description.</p>
      <p>Starting with the kickboxing fights, when we look at a fighter’s legacy, we rarely count early losses before they hit their prime. Islam Makhachev, for instance, lost his first fight in the UFC at age 24. Now, as he flirts with the GOAT moniker, fans ignore that loss because he was a “tadpole”. Similarly, Merab Dvalishvili, a top 15 fighter of all time lost his first two UFC fights at 27 years old, but like Makachev’s these early loses are hand-waved away. I believe the same grace should apply to Izzy, who fought Pereira at 26 which is before the combat sports prime of 28 - 34.</p>
      <p>Even if you do count their first kickboxing match, the fact remains that Izzy probably won that fight. Responding to this by appealing to judges authority (Logical fallacy btw) does not suffice. Judges can, and often do make judging mistakes. This should be self-evident, because if judges were perfect, we’d only need 1 but in combat sports we typically have 3. From this it follows that juries are imperfect. Furthermore, judges often disagree on individual rounds. If one judge gives awards round 1 to Fighter A, while the other to Fighter B, They cannot simultaneously both be correct. Now, if you take my word, and Joe Rogan’s (who admittedly I’d never cite in another context), their record is 2–2.</p>
      <p>Even if you don’t buy this, Izzy still wins solely off of their final encounter in Miami.</p>
      <p>In every story, fiction or historical, when someone fails repeatedly, they can redeem themselves with one win. Neville Longbottom was a joke for 7 books, then clutched up once against the Snake and became a legend. Luke Skywalker lost his hand to Vader, but won their last duel. Zuko took nothing but repeated, constant, Ls from Azula, but in their last encounter was frying Azula until Katara got involved. In history my GOAT Joseph Robinette Biden ran for office four times but only won once, yet in no Biden comment sections do I see “3-1”.</p>
      <p>One big win at the right moment changes the story and Izzy’s knockout did that.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The A in MMA stands for ART and the red blood fighters paint the appropriately named “canvas”.</p>
      <p>The rivalry between Adesnaya and Perierea was an indisputably legendary affair, and their brush strokes of violence left an artistic masterpiece in its wake, regardless of who won.</p>
