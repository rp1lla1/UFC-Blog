      <h1>Charles Oliveira Has a Chance</h1>
      <p class="post-meta"><em>Posted on June 24, 2025</em></p>

      <p>When Ilia, "the Connor McGregor Cosplayer" Topuria, vacated his featherweight world championship, moved up to the vaunted lightweight division, and called for a fight its king, and pound-for-pound #1 in the world, Islam Makhachev, fans were enticed by the prospect of a generational fight between the two. Unfortunately, this dream matchup fell through when Belal Muhammad, Islam‚Äôs friend and the champion of the 170-pound welterweight division, lost his belt to Jack Della Maddalena. This gave Islam his long awaited opportunity to vacate the 155-pound belt, and seek double-champ status himself.</p>

      <p>That brings us to June 28, when at UFC 317, WE (as in you and I) will step into battle and win (üôè) the Lightweight Championship of the world alongside the uber-popular, uber-exciting, and number 2 ranked (number 1 in our hearts) former champion, Charles Oliveira, as he takes on Ilia Topuria for the now-vacant lightweight strap.</p>

      <p>The opening fight odds for this matchup are heinous. According to DraftKings, Ilia is a -425 favorite, and Charles Oliveira is a disgraceful +325 underdog. That gives Ilia an implied win probability of around 80 percent, the widest margin in any Charles Oliveira fight since he entered the title picture. I believe these odds are incredibly disrespectful to Oliveira's chances, and in this post, I will argue that Charles can win the fight.</p>

      <h2> Charles Has a Shot</h2>

      <p>The first thing to keep in mind is that this fight is in the lightweight division, the division Charles has called home for the better part of a decade, and the division Ilia has entered only once prior. In that sole appearance, he got dropped by unranked bum Jai Herbert (2-4-1 in the UFC btw) and scurried out of the division. Now, ask yourself, if Topuria's weight cut to featherweight was truly as brutal as he now, claims, then why did he move back down to featherweight after the Herbert fight? Perhaps because while he could scrape out the win against such a journeyman, the elite of the division would simply be too big. On fight night, Charles will be visibly bigger, stronger, and taller than Ilia. He will also enjoy a 5-inch reach advantage, which is far greater than the T-rex reach of Max Holloway and Alexander Volkanovski</p>

      <p><strong>This gives Charles several legitimate paths to victory.</strong></p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Charles could win by wrestle maxxing.</strong> In his fight against All-American wrestler Michael Chandler, Oliveira morphed into Charles Nurmagomedov, dominating the scrap through takedowns, top control, and calculated engagements. Even in his loss to Islam Makhachev, there were moments when Oliveira controlled the Dagestani wrestler with what fans aptly call his "zesty clinch". If he chooses to lean into this physical side, he could grind out a boring decision (we do not care) by neutralizing Topuria‚Äôs boxing in this way</li>
        <li><strong>Charles could knock out Ilia Topuria,</strong> who has never truly experienced lightweight power. The sort of power that Charles holsters in both paws. Former opponent Justin Gaethje, who has fought the murder‚Äôs row at lightweight, Poirier, Chandler, and Nurmagomedov, to name a few, professed Oliveira‚Äôs punches were the hardest he‚Äôs ever been hit with. Pair this with the fact that in his fights against Volkanovski and Holloway, Topuria absorbed nearly as many head strikes as he landed, and it becomes clear that Oliveira can finish the fight by KO/TKO.</li>
        <li><strong>And then there‚Äôs the most dangerous threat of all: submission.</strong> Oliveira is the paradigmatic submission artist of the UFC as he holds the record for the most submission wins in UFC history. Mind you, he has achieved this incredible feat by utilizing 7 unique submissions, underscoring that he can pack up Topuria at any moment from practically any position. Toporia, ever the pompous prick, has even said that he would like to engage in grappling with Olviera to prove he is better. I would say he should be careful what he wishes for. (if actually makes Olivera tap, the ancient japanese art may perhaps be justified )</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Overrated?</h2>

      <p>Hear me out. There is also a real possibility that Ilia Topuria is overrated. Sure, his resume which includes knocking out Volkanovski and Holloway might be the best back-to-back wins in UFC history, but both came with notable asterisks. He fought Volk just three months after Unc was viciously head-kicked by Islam Makhachev, which was clearly not enough recovery time. He then faced Max Holloway, who looked severely drained after cutting down from lightweight and could explain his suddenly feeble chin. And before those two wins, he went to a decision with Josh Emmett, proving that it's possible to last 25 minutes in a pure striking contest with him.</p>

      <p>Additionally, none of Topuria‚Äôs recent opponents used wrestling as a key part of their strategy. This is important because even the threat of a takedown can throw off elite strikers. There are plenty of examples. Merab outstruck Sean O'Malley in their rematch largely because of the constant wrestling pressure. Jan Blachowicz used takedowns to shut down Israel Adesanya‚Äôs scintillating striking when Izzy moved up to light heavyweight. If Oliveira forces Topuria to think about takedowns, not even necceseserilly landing them, it could limit the boxing that is clearly Topuria‚Äôs best path to victory.</p>

      <p>Against Ilia's power, Charles also possesses his secret weapon: his guard. If/When Charles gets cracked he can always fall to the ground, regain his bearings and dare Toporia to enter which strikers like Poirier and Gaethje have been scared of. At the very least this will give Charles a chance to lock back in. At best, Topuria might dare to enter the guard and give Olivera chances at a submission.</p>


      <p>Finally, to the degree which you find vibes/aura compelling, insofar as Topuria is actually Connor McGregor Mc 2.0, then history may repeat itself. People forget man, but Connor lost that first fight after moving up in weight. That loss came by submission to a Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt named Nate Diaz.</p>

      <p>All that said, in a recent interview, Ilia is quoted to have said, ‚Äú'I'll just touch his head and it will explode‚Äù‚Ä¶</p>

      <p>‚Ä¶</p>

      <p>It may be over for my goat.</p>

      <p>Anyways, Thank you immensely for reading my first blog post!</p>
