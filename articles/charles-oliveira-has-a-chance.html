      <h1>Charles Oliveira Has a Chance</h1>
      <p class="post-meta"><em>Posted on [ ]</em></p>

      <p>When Ilia, "the Connor McGregor Cosplayer" Topuria, vacated his featherweight world championship, moved up to the vaunted lightweight division, and called for a fight its king, and pound-for-pound #1 in the world, Islam Makhachev, fans were enticed by the prospect of a generational fight between the two. Unfortunately, this dream matchup fell through when Belal Muhammad, Islam‚Äôs friend and the champion of the 170-pound welterweight division, lost his belt to Jack Della Maddalena. This gave Islam his long awaited opportunity to vacate the 155-pound belt, and seek double-champ status himself.</p>

      <p>That brings us to June 28, when at UFC 317, WE (as in you and I) will step into battle and win (üôè) the Lightweight Championship of the world alongside the uber-popular, uber-exciting, and number 2 ranked (number 1 in our hearts) former champion, Charles Oliveira, as he takes on Ilia Topuria for the now-vacant lightweight strap.</p>

      <p>The opening fight odds for this matchup are heinous. According to DraftKings, Ilia is a -425 favorite, and Charles Oliveira is a disgraceful +325 underdog. That gives Ilia an implied win probability of around 80 percent, the widest margin in any Charles Oliveira fight since he entered the title picture. I believe these odds are incredibly disrespectful to Oliveira's chances, and in this post, I will argue that Charles can win the fight.</p>

      <h2>Why Charles Has a Shot</h2>

      <p>The first thing to keep in mind is that this fight is in the lightweight division, the division Charles has called home for the better part of a decade, and the division Ilia has entered only once prior. In that sole appearance, he got dropped by unranked bum Jai Herbert (2-4-1 in the UFC btw) and scurried out of the division...</p>

      <p><strong>This gives Charles several legitimate paths to victory.</strong></p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Charles could win by wrestle maxxing.</strong> In his fight against All-American wrestler Michael Chandler...</li>
        <li><strong>Charles could knock out Ilia Topuria,</strong> who has never truly experienced lightweight power...</li>
        <li><strong>And then there‚Äôs the most dangerous threat of all: submission.</strong> Oliveira is the peak submission artist of the UFC...</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Overrated?</h2>

      <p>Hear me out. There is also a real possibility that Ilia Topuria is overrated...</p>

      <p>Additionally, none of Topuria‚Äôs recent opponents used wrestling as a key part of their strategy...</p>

      <p>Against Ilia's power, Charles also possesses his secret weapon: his guard...</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>Finally, to the degree which you find vibes/aura compelling, insofar as Topuria is actually Connor McGregor Mc 2.0, then history may repeat itself...</p>

      <p>All that said, in a recent interview, Ilia is quoted to have said, ‚Äú'I'll just touch his head and it will explode‚Äù‚Ä¶</p>

      <p>‚Ä¶</p>

      <p>It may be over for my goat.</p>

      <p>Anyways, Thank you immensely for reading my first blog post!</p>
