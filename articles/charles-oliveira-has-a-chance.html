    <h1>Charles Oliveira Has a Chance</h1>
    <p><em>Posted on [ ]</em></p>

    <p>When Ilia Topuria, in his pursuit of goat status, vacated his featherweight world championship and called for a fight against pound for pound king and lightweight champion Islam Makhachev, fans had a chance at watching a contemporary Conor-Khabib 2.0. Unfortunately, this fell through when Belal Muhammad, Islam’s friend and the champion of the 170-pound welterweight division, lost his belt to Jack Della Maddalena. This gave Islam his long awaited opportunity, vacate his 155-pound belt, and move up to the welterweight division.</p>

    <p>That brings us to now, when Oon June 28 at UFC 317, the uber-popular and uber-exciting number 2 ranked, former lightweight champion of the world, and my personal favorite fighter, Charles Oliveira, will fight Ilia Topuria for the now vacant lightweight strap.</p>

    <p>The opening fight odds for this matchup are heinous. According to DraftKings, Ilia is a -425 favorite, and Charles Oliveira is a disgraceful +325 underdog. That gives Ilia an implied win probability of around 80 percent, the widest margin in any Charles Oliveira fight since he entered the title picture. I believe these odds are incredibly disrespectful to Oliveira's chances, and in this post, I will defend my approxomation of ~50%.</p>

    <p>The first thing to keep in mind is that this fight is in the lightweight division, the division Charles has called home for eight years, and the division Ilia has entered only once prior. In that sole appearance, he got dropped by unranked bum Jai Herbert. If Topuria's weight cut to featherweight was truly as brutal as he now, claims, then why did he move back down to featherweight after the fight against Herbert? Perhaps because while he could scrape out the win against an unranked lightweights, the elite of the division would simply be too big. On fight night, Charles will be visibly bigger, stronger, and taller than Ilia. He will also enjoy a 5-inch reach advantage, which is far greater than the T-rex reach of Max Holloway and Alexander Volkanovski, who are Torporia's best wins.</p>

    <p><strong>This gives Charles several legitimate paths to victory.</strong></p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>He could knock out an Ilia Topuria</strong>, who has never truly experienced lightweight power. The sort of power that Charles holsters in both paws. Former opponent Justin Gaethje, who has fought the murder’s row at lightweight, Poirier, Chandler, and Nurmagomedov, to name a few, professed Oliveira’s punches were the hardest he’s ever been hit with. Pair this with the fact that in his fights against Volkanovski and Holloway, Topuria absorbed nearly as many head strikes as he landed, and it becomes clear that Oliveira can finish the fight by KO/TKO.</li>

      <li><strong>Charles could also win by wrestly maxxing .</strong> In his fight against All-American wrestler Michael Chandler, Oliveira morphed into Charles Nurmagomedov, dominating the scrap through his takedowns and top control. Even in his loss to Islam Makhachev, there were moments when Oliveira controlled the clinch. If he chooses to lean into that physical style, he could grind out a decision by neutralizing Topuria’s boxing.</li>

      <li><strong>And then there’s the most dangerous threat of all: submission.</strong> Oliveira is the pinnacle of a submission artist and he holds the record for the most submission wins in UFC history. He can tap Topuria at any moment from practically any position. If the fight hits the ground, even briefly, Topuria, who has never fought someone with this level of jiu-jitsu, could get packed up in seconds.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Overrated?</strong></p>

    <p>Now, hear me out. There is also a real possibility that Ilia Topuria is overrated. Sure, his resume which includes knocking out Volkanovski and Holloway might be the best back-to-back wins in UFC history, but both came with notable asterisks. He fought Volk just three months after unc was viciously head-kicked by Islam Makhachev, which was clearly not enough recovery time. He then faced Max Holloway, who looked severely drained after cutting down from lightweight. And before those two wins, he went to decision with Josh Emmett, proving that it's possible to last 25 minutes in a pure striking contest with him.</p>

    <p>Additionally, none of Topuria’s recent opponents used wrestling as a key part of their strategy. This is important because even the threat of a takedown can throw off elite strikers. There are plenty of examples. Merab outstruck Sean O'Malley in their rematch largely because of the constant wrestling pressure. Jan Blachowicz used takedowns to shut down Israel Adesanya’s striking when Izzy moved up to light heavyweight. If Oliveira forces Topuria to think about takedowns, not even necceseserilly landing them, it could limit the boxing that is clearly Topuria’s best path to victory.</p>

    <p>Against Ilia's power, Charles also possesses his secret weapon: his guard. If/When Charles gets cracked he can always fall to the ground, regain his bearings and dare Toporia to enter which strikers like Poirier and Gaethje have been scared of. At the very least this will give Charles a chance to lock back in. At best, Topuria might dare to enter the guard and give Olivera chances at a submission.</p>

    <p>Finally, and I admit this is less compelling if you don’t believe in fate or symbolism, but it is worth considering. If Topuria is truly Conor 2.0, a parallel that both fans and Topuria himself buy into, then history may repeat itself. As great as Conor was, people forget man, Connor lost that first fight after moving up in weight. That loss came to a Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt named Nate Diaz.</p>

    <p>All that said, in a recent interview, Ilia is quoted to have said, “'I'll just touch his head and it will explode”…<br></p>

    <p> … <p>
      
    <p>It may be over for my goat.</p>
