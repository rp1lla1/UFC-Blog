      <h1>Oil Him Up</h1>
      <p class="post-meta"><em>Posted on June 26, 2025</em></p>

      <p><strong>‚ÄúJon Jones called us last night and retired.‚Äù</strong> What the actual fuck, Baldy.</p>

      <p>You pink pigmented pig (nice alliteration, Roshan).</p>

      <p>This post will not be about what Jon Jones's blatant ducking means for his legacy or how the dude has no right to be considered the Greatest of All Time given his numerous PED violations, arrests, and perhaps worst of all, the AI-generated nature of his retirement post. I‚Äôll leave that to MMA Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube. Rather, I will take this opportunity to rant about the handling of the retirement by bubble gum-colored b***** (no swearing) Dana ‚ÄúBaldy‚Äù White.</p>

      <p>On June 21, 2025, after Khalil Roundtree casually mollywhopped Jamahal Hill for five rounds in the main event, Baldy nonchalantly mentions that Jon Jones has retired. No warning. No oil-him-up Instagram Live teasing big news. Nope. Some random reporter asks, probably for the hundredth time, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs happening at heavyweight,‚Äù and the goofball just drops that the biggest star in the sport is wrapping it up. No buzz. Fricking crickets.</p>

      <p>All this takes place in Baku, Azerbaijan. Phonetically, I like the word Baku, <strong>BUT WHY THE FUCK DO YOU MENTION IT THERE?</strong> International Fight Week is next week, and the rose-colored rascal could have saved the announcement or even teased it to build hype. Instead, what was supposed to be the best card of the year now lacks all aura, despite being objectively good and even featuring Charles Oliveira.</p>

      <p>The current promotion strategy, or lack thereof, shows a complete disinterest in growing the sport. The UFC knows it has a dedicated fan base. Even if PPV sales are down because WE (you and I) pirate the events, the UFC still bears responsibility. They rely on a loyal following and exploit it with bad marketing and brain rot slop injected through CrackedStreams and StreamEast. Just a few months ago, they asked us to pay $80 for a card whose feature fight was Justin Tafa vs. Tallison Teixeira ü•Ä</p>

      <p>The UFC has a star problem, and it‚Äôs been talked about ad nauseam by the company and its commentators. While they act confused, the answer is plainly obvious to fans. <strong>HOW DO YOU CREATE STARS IF YOU DO NOT PROMOTE THEM?</strong></p>

      <p>Jon Jones‚Äôs retirement could‚Äôve been the catalyst to build Tom Aspinall into a household name. The branding writes itself: the man to emasculate Jon Jones. The man who, on average, knocks opponents out within two minutes. That and 3 solid TikTok edits, and the casuals would‚Äôve known the new champion of the premier division in the sport. But instead? Silence. No push. No spotlight. It‚Äôs a complete abandonment of a generational talent.</p>

      <p>The worst part in all this is Dana White is capable of resplendent promotion. Even recently he showcased these capabilities for UFC 300, a genuinely incredible event. Instead of tapping into these latent talents, Baldy is pouring his energy into hyping the Canelo vs. Crawford boxing event, even choosing not to have a UFC event in September. Sure, Canelo‚ÄìCrawford is a generational clash between two greats. Yes, it deserves promotion. <strong>But holy shit, this man is neglecting the sport he has a vested interest in to boost the UFC‚Äôs biggest competitor.</strong></p>

      <p>All of this makes me feel like a bot for watching this sport. In every other league, whether it‚Äôs PFL in MMA or a different sport like the NBA, promotions go all-out to make fans care. They try everything. But here, the UFC brass doesn‚Äôt care at all. They don‚Äôt even pretend to care. We got 200,000 people to sign a petition and Baldy‚Äôs response equated to ‚Äúdoesn't matter, we‚Äôve got a billion fans worldwide.‚Äù Entitlement is an ick but fans deserve more.</p>

      <p>Anyway, what an unceremonious, aura-less conclusion to an undeniable legend of our sport. The NBA will roll out a massive retirement tour for its GOAT, LeBron James, and we get a casual ‚Äúnah, he‚Äôs gone.‚Äù</p>
